# AI Code Evaluator Interface

This tool helps simulate the evaluation of two AI-generated code versions by analyzing:
- Lines of code
- Number of control structures (like loops and conditions)

## Usage
```bash
python main.py
```

Paste two versions of code, and it will output a simple evaluation.
